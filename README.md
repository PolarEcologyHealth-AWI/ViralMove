# ViralMove

## Simulation_test.R
- Northward
- 4 Species
- With infection status

## OptimSDP.R
- Infection status (backward: expFly, expFor)
- Forward simulation (infection status, infection probability at sites, latency, recovery, no conversion)
- Forward simulation, infeciton risk per site (inf = p)
- New function: dispInf - dispersal of viruses

## ToDo
- Southward migration
- SIRS
-
